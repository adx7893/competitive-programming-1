0.  Pneunomoultramicroscopicsillicovolcanoiosis - is a word in cs50 dictionaries/large file.
    Which is an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease cause by inhaling very fine ash and dust.


1.  Getrusage - It is a function which returns resource usage for -
    
    (i) RUSAGE_SELF - returns resource usage statistics for the calling process which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the
    process.

    (ii) RUSAGE_CHILDREN - returns resource usage statistics for all children of the calling process that have ternimated or being waited for.    
    (iii) RUSAGE_THREAD - returns resource usage statistics for the calling thread.


2.  According to the man page the structure rusage have 16 members 
    
    (1)  struct timeval ru_utime 
    (2)  struct timeval ru_stime
    (3)  long ru_maxrss
    (4)  long ru_ixrss
    (5)  long ru_idrss
    (6)  long ru_isrss
    (7)  long ru_minflt
    (8)  long ru_majflt
    (9)  long ru_nswap 
    (10) long ru_inblock
    (11) long ru_oublock
    (12) long ru_msgsnd
    (13) long ru_msgrcv
    (14) long ru_nsignal
    (15) long ru_nvcsw
    (16) long ru_nivcsw



3.  If we want to use a different dictionary so that's wont become a problem.


4.  As the command line argument loads the file into program. if the character is != end-of-file iteration starts inside for loop and checks
    for first if condition if character is alphabetical or is ' - single quote it execute the line in if block which says add the character to    the word. Then it checks for index that if the word is > 45 read through it and initilize index to zero for next word to read. if the 
    value readed isdigit the it also reads it and initilize index to zero for next word to read. // not completed do it again.


5.  We use fgetc rather than fscanf because we want to check the spelling of each word ( that means we have to check each letter or character at a time to compare with other words ) %s will read whole string whereas %c only read a character at a time.


6.  We declare parameter for check and load const ( constant ) because we want to load and check the following word and did not want to change any word in the file or in memory . 


7.  I use a hash table data structure for the sake of simplicity. I take the simplest approch for solving this problem set with hash tables. 
    The suructure of my node contains a char array have length of 45 + 1 for words and node* next for next pointer value.


8.  My code works just find at the beginning of the program but than i modify some code to make it just works efficiently as per the problem set specs . I don't remember the exact values but after the little twinks my code works very fast not as much like yours but it works fine. 


9.  I change my code little bit what i do is to check for the values for the hshfunc ( case - sensitive ) the send the following key so that the program run fast and i also change the whole code of size() function so that it takes advantage of running load() function and counts the  words at the time of load . 


10. Yes , i find hard to implement the trie data structure i dont know why but i thinks that if i use the trie approach my programs will run more effenciently and i also want to tweek little bit more just to make my spell checker more fast for that i use some new algorithm that i has not apply to it yet.
